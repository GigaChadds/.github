# GAAVE

## Problem Statement

There is not enough philanthropy in the world due to the lack of engagement towards donors.

## Solution

A platform where crypto users could deposit their cryptocurrencies to generate yield for a cause. To further drive engagement, soulbound NFTs would be available for claim whenever a user reaches certain milestone when generating yield for a cause.
